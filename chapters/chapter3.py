The LIN protocol does not have a flow control which the LIN slave can use to \
pause a message reception so the size of the LIN slave message buffer shall \
not limit the size of supported diagnostic services.

The LIN slave Receiver message buffer shall be large enough to handle any \
diagnostic request the LIN slave is required to handle. Note that if possible \
the LIN slave may implement a strategy where earlier received data is freed to \
make room for new data and thus lowering the need for buffer.

The LIN slave shall abort the currently received message if the message is \
faulty in regards LIN   TP. The slave node shall abort processing of a \
transport layer message after:
* Reception of a valid master request (except when NAD is the functional NAD)
* Reception of a master request that is valid concerning the LIN protocol, \
but with absurd data, e.g. wrong PCI (except when NAD is the functional NAD).

timer runs. The LIN master shall not time out N_Cr transport protocol timer on \
first frames (FF). However N_Cr timer is still applicable for consecutive \
frames (CF).""")

cd("/*/Transport protocol handling in LIN master requirements")
Inf("""The master node and the diagnostic tester are connected via a back-bone \

correct LIN cluster(s). Responses from the slave nodes shall be gatewayed back \
to the back-bone bus through the master node.

All diagnostic requests and responses (services) addressed to the slave nodes \
can be routed in the network layer (i.e. no application layer routing), if the \
Diagnostic and Transport Layer Protocol of tester back-bone-bus master node \
fulfills the respective needs. In this case, the master node must implement \
the LIN transport protocol, see Transport Layer Specification, as well as the \
transport protocols used on the backbone busses (e.g. ISO15765-2 on CAN).""")

cd("/*/Slave node transmission handler requirements")
Inf("""Slave nodes are typically electronic devices that are not involved in a \
complex data communication. LIN diagnostics defines 3 classes of diagnostic \
slave nodes detailing the diagnostic communication and performance. The \
diagnostic data is transported by the LIN protocol as specified in the \
Protocol Specification.

Although diagnostics and node configuration services use the same frame IDs, \
i.e. 0x3C (master request frame) and 0x3D (slave response frame), different \
services are used for configuration and diagnostics. Node configuration can be \
performed by the master node independently while diagnostic services are \
always routed on request from an external or internal test tool. Both \
use-cases use the same node address (NAD) and transport protocol with the \
exception that configuration is always performed via Single Frames. Only slave \
nodes have a NAD.
The NAD is also used as the source address in a diagnostic slave response frame.
Transmission handler is to allow for diagnostic communication without frame \
collisions on the cluster. During diagnostics the broadcast NAD is normally \
not used. If this will happen the slave node will process requests with \
broadcast NAD (0x7F) in the same way as if it is the slave nodeâ€™s own NAD. \
Note the difference between the broadcast NAD (0x7F) and functional NAD (0x7E).
The following states are defined:

* **Idle**. In this state the slave node is neither receiving nor transmitting \
any messages in the cluster. It is consequently available for any incoming \
request from the master node. It shall not respond to slave response frames.

* **Receive physical request**. In this state the slave node is receiving a \
transmission from the master node. It is receiving and processing the \
transport layer frames as received from the master node. The slave node shall \
ignore any interleaved functional addressed transmission from the master node.

* **Transmit physical response**.
In this state a slave node is currently still processing the previously \
received request, is ready to transmit a physical response or is actually \
transmitting the response to the previously received request. A slave node \
shall not receive nor process interleaved functional addressed (NAD 0x7E) \
transmissions from the master node. Physical transmissions shall be received \
and will make the slave node discard the current request data or response \
data. If the request is addressed to the slave node the request shall be \
received and processed.

* **Receive functional request**. In this state a slave node is receiving a \
functional transmission from the master node. The slave node shall not respond \
to any slave response frames. If more than one LIN slave tries to send a \
diagnostic response simultaneously on the same LIN network there will be \
collisions on the network, and all diagnostic responses will be lost. By \
preventing the LIN slaves from sending diagnostic responses on functional \
requests, there shall not be any collision on the LIN network. LIN slaves \
shall process functionally addressed diagnostic requests, but after the \
request has been processed the LIN slave shall discard the functionally \
addressed diagnostic request without sending any response (regardless state \
of SPRMIB bit).Since the LIN slave shall be available for new diagnostic \
requests directly after functionally addressed diagnostic requests, the \
P2Server_max for functionally addressed diagnostic requests shall be less \
than the time it takes to send a frame on LIN. The LIN master shall consider \
a functionally addressed diagnostic request completed as soon as the LIN \
master have sent the request on LIN i.e. the LIN master shall not poll for a \
diagnostic response (send frame identifier 0x3D) for functionally addressed \
requests.""")

1. **Idle â†’ Receive physical request**

 **Condition:** A master request frame has been received with the NAD matching \
 the slave node's own NAD.

 **Action:** Start receiving and processing the physical request according to \
 the transport layer requirements.

2. **Receive physical request â†’ Idle**

**Condition:** A transport layer error has occurred or a master request frame \
with an NAD different from the slave node's own NAD has been received.

**Action:** Stop receiving and processing the physical request. Do not respond \
to slave response frames.

3. **Receive physical request â†’ Receive physical request**

**Condition:** The physical request has not been completely received yet and \
master request frames are received with the NAD set to the slave node's own \
NAD. A functional addressed master request frame shall be ignored.

**Action:** Continue receiving and processing the physical request.

4. **Receive physical request â†’ Transmit physical response**

**Condition:** The physical request has been completely received.

**Action:** Process the diagnostic request. If a new physical request with the \
NAD set to the slave node's own address is received while processing the \
previous request, the slave node shall discard the current request or response \
data and shall start receiving the new request.

5. **Transmit physical response â†’ Transmit physical response**

**Condition:** The physical response has not been completely transmitted yet. \
A functional addressed request shall be ignored.

**Action:** Keep responding to slave response frames according to the \
transport layer requirements.

Note: A slave node will not process a functional addressed request while in \
transmit physical response state. Therefore it must be ensured by the external \
test tool that functionally addressed requests that shall be processed by all \
slave nodes are only transmitted if no further responses from any slave node \
are expected. Otherwise there's no guarantee nor indication for the external \
test tool whether a slave node has processed the functional request.

6. **Transmit physical response â†’ Idle**

**Condition:** The physical response has been completely transmitted, a LIN \
transport layer error occurred or a request with the NAD set to a different \
or the same value as the slave node's own NAD has been received.

**Action:** Discard the request and response data. Stop responding to slave \
response frames.

7. **Idle â†’ Receive functional request**

**Condition:** A master request frame with the NAD parameter set to the \
functional NAD has been received.

**Action:** Receive and process the master request frame according to the \
transport layer. Do not respond to the slave response frame headers.

8. **Receive functional request â†’ Idle**

**Condition:** The functional request was processed.

**Action:** Discard any response data. Stop responding to slave response frames.

9. **Receive functional request â†’ Idle**

 **Condition:** No request is received and no response is pending.

 **Action:** Do not respond to any slave response frames.

10. **Transmit physical response â†’ Receive physical request**

**Condition:** The previous request has been processed and a diagnostic \
master request frame with the NAD parameter set to the slave node's own \
node address has been received.

**Action:** Discard the response data. Start receiving and processing the \
physical request according to the LIN transport protocol requirements.
