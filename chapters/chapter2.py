Inf("""

 **PRIMARY BOOTLOADER (PBL)**

The PBL is designed to be permanently placed in a protected flash boot sector. \
The primary bootloader (PBL) has the important task of loading the SBL into the \
CPU internal RAM and transfer the control to secondary boot loader (SBL).
The primary bootloader (PBL) shall have a time window of 20msec (Â±10%) for \
detection of the DiagnosticSessionControl service. If a \
DiagnosticSessionControl service with diagnosticSessionType equal to \
programmingSession is received during the 20msec time window after power on, \
the ECU shall enter programmingSession.
If not, the ECU shall exit the PBL and jump to the application if valid \
application is present and if application is also not present ,it transits to \
default session.

The code size of the PBL in the target must be very small (so that it can \
easily fit into a boot flash sector). The code must also be correct, since \
after the primary bootloader is programmed into a protected flash boot sector \
there is no chance to update a software error after an ECU is produced. The \
memory area containing the PBL shall be protected from erasure to eliminate \
the possibility of accidentally erasing it. The PBL shall only be capable of \
writing data to RAM due to security and data integrity.
An erase of the flash memory can only occur if the secondary bootloader (SBL) \
is downloaded into RAM. The PBL shall not be able to overwrite or modify any \
of its own memory and the standard SBL shall not be able to overwrite or erase \
the PBL. The PBL shall provide functions to identify the ECU hardware (i.e. \
ECU Delivery Assembly Number, ECU Core Assembly Number and Boot Software \
Identification).When an ECU transitions to the programmingSession, the primary \
bootloader will need to pre-condition all of the ECU's I/O into a state where \
components cannot be damaged and the area is safe for people working on \
the vehicle.

**SECONDARY BOOTLOADER (SBL)**

The SBL includes all routines for flash erase and flash program of data to an \
ECU. The SBL is downloaded with the help of the PBL into RAM. After download \
the SBL is activated from the PBL.
The SBL services are now added (super set to the PBL) and can be used together \
with the PBL services. This means that all PBL services shall be capable of \
being executed after the SBL has been downloaded and activated.

The implementation of SBL also includes all PBL services. This provides two \
advantage and they are:

* If an error is found in the PBL, it is possible to make a workaround \
solution in the SBL.
* No calls are necessary from the SBL to the PBL, which simplify the \
bootloader implementation.

After download and start of execution of the SBL in RAM, it shall not be \
possible to make a new download to RAM (i.e., ECU shall reject request with \
NRC 31 hex). Before a new download to RAM can be performed, an exit from the \
programmingSession shall be required the reason for this is to avoid \
overwriting the SBL.""")

cd("/*/Bootloader states")

defaultSession or the programmingSession. After power on the PBL shall \
begin an initialization phase where it waits for a DiagnosticSesssionControl \

entry detection at startup.""")

To avoid problems with hardware initialization (i.e., write once registers, \

solution is that the bootloader always starts executing from reset when the \
application software receives a DiagnosticSessionControl (programmingSession) \
service.

The control will come to the Bootloader from application by sending \
DiagnosticSessionControl (programmingSession as session type) request only \
once. Upon this request, application shall be write the fixed bit pattern in a \
fixed address in RAM and trigger Watchdog reset.

The BL checks for the pattern 0X5A5A5A5A at fixed RAM Location and clear the \
bit pattern, then control will be transferred to the Bootloader. Refer the \
